# vManage API application - Code Guide

## Description

The objective of this code-along exercise is to create an app that connects to vmanage API to perform some basic calls

There are 4 main tasks to complete, follow each one of them to develop the app

Instructor will indicate when to start each task and will show a quick "solution" before moving with the next one

To test we will use the following Lab vManage

    vManage: 10.89.1.134
    username: apilover
    password: Cisco12345!

## Github repository

First step is to clone a github repository that includes the folder and file structure we will follow

Our work will be to populate the empty functions within the files with the code needed

Use the following command on your terminal to clone the repo to your laptop

    git clone https://wwwin-github.cisco.com/rgomezbe/vmanage_api_training
